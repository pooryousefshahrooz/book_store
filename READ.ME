You need to run each microservice and each replication of the microservice with its IP addresses and port number. 

We have defined the IP address and port number that each microservice will be running on in the  "each\_server\_IP.txt" file. 

For example, for running the order microservice, you need to run the command "python3 order\_microservice.py 127.0.0.4 5004" where 127.0.0.4 is the IP address and 5004 is the port number that this replication of the order microservice will be running on. 

For running the frond-end microservice, you do not need to specify the IP address and port number. Just running the command "python3 front\_end\_caching" is enough. 

Note that, if you want to have multiple replications of each microservice, you have to define the IP address and the port number in the  "each\_server\_IP.txt" file and run that replication separately manually in the terminal.
